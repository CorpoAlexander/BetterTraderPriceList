# BetterTraderPriceList - a utility to view buyable/sellable items from the BetterTrader Valheim mod configuration file.
Download the utility, load index.html in the browser of your choice, and select your Better Trader config file.  I primarily built this project for myself, if it is of any use to you enjoy in good health.
